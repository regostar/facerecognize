    "# - **os:** We will use this Python module to read our training directories and file names.\n",

    "# The more images used in training the better. Normally a lot of images are used for training a face recognizer so that it can learn different looks of the same person, for example with glasses, without glasses, laughing, sad, happy, crying, with beard, without beard etc. To keep our tutorial simple we are going to use only 12 images for each person. \n",
    "# \n",
    "# So our training data consists of total 2 persons with 12 images of each person. All training data is inside _`training-data`_ folder. _`training-data`_ folder contains one folder for each person and **each folder is named with format `sLabel (e.g. s1, s2)` where label is actually the integer label assigned to that person**. For example folder named s1 means that this folder contains images for person 1. The directory structure tree for training data is as follows:\n",
